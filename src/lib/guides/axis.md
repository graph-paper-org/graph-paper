# Axis Components

The axis components provide a way to draw simple positional axes in a data
graphic. They include:

1. `Axis` â€“ a simple component that draws the ticks, labels, and border of an
   axis for you, with minimal setup.
1. `AxisContainer` a parent component that performs most of the necessary
   calculation for the other Axis component children. Use this and the children
   below for custom axes.
1. `AxisTick` draws a tick at a location at the location specified.
1. `AxisLabel` draws the label at the location specified.
1. `AxisLine` draws the line connecting the ticks at the location specified.

**FIXME: list props for each component**
