# Icons

This package contains a small set of icons needed to build data apps. It
primarily consists of adapted icons from the
[Photon Design System](https://design.firefox.com/photon/) (in all cases, merely
adding a `size` prop) or icons the graph-paper team has contributed. Attribution
is given in either direction in all cases.

## how to use the icons

To install, run

```
npm install @graph-paper/icons
```

To use in a component, try

```svelte
<script>
  import { ArrowheadLeft } from "@graph-paper/icons";
</script>

<span><ArrowheadLeft size={16} /> See More </span>
```

_NOTE:_ there is no stylesheet associated with these icons, so when using the
Svelte REPL, you will not need to import the style.
