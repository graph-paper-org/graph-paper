# graph-paper

A Svelte component library optimized for data visualizations and data apps.

_note: this project is in very early alpha, and as such is subject to API
changes and restructuring without notice._

See the graph-paper storybook at
[https://graph-paper-org.github.io/graph-paper/](https://graph-paper-org.github.io/graph-paper/)

## installation

graph-paper is (for now) one big package. Don't worry, when your app is bundled,
anything not needed should be discarded. Install it as follows:

```
npm install --save-dev @graph-paper/graph-paper
```

## development

1. Run `npm install`
2. Run `npm run storybook`

See the [developer documentation](docs/development.md) for more information.
